#Gettin' Hammer'd

I'm using [hammerspoon](http://hammerspoon.org/) as a window manager and menu bar replacement
for OS X. Trying to bring the experience of [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) and
[lemonbar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar) to Mac.

##Utils

* [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) ([nightly build](https://iterm2.com/downloads/nightly/#/section/home))
* [weechat](https://weechat.org/)

...and more
